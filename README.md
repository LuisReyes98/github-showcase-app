# GitHub showcase app

#### notes:

In the `lighttouch.scl` file the fields `github_client_id` and `github_client_secret` belong to the client id and client secret of your github api app , if you don't have one you can create it [here](https://github.com/settings/developers) , be sure to never reveal these information to the client in the html or other ways that might be dangerous.
